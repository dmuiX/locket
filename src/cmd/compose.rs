//! Handlers for Docker Compose Provider service
//!
//! Provider services are expected to handle `up` and `down` commands,
//! to be invoked by `docker compose` CLI prior to starting or stopping services.
//! This also implemented the optional `metadata` command, which allows Docker
//! to query the provider for its capabilities.
//! The metadata is derived from clap configuration on-demand.
